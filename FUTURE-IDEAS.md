ideas

- customize your square
- limit of players
- vertical scrolling scoreboard
- hidable nav bar and controls
- time limit???
- fix double jump
- crown above previous rounds winner (resets to current winner as others win)
- store map data (from random generator algorithm) in a db and use a key / hash of some sort to re-access it at another time (mainly for highscores or time-trials)
- implement random game mode picker once more than 1 game mode is done
- attacks?? Some way to kill others and make them respawn. This system can be used for many things
- arrows keys function as wasd
- funny quotes on loading screens
- fix up the initial loading screen to include the socket connection so you dont wait on a blank screen to join the game

game modes

- coin collect (main game already)
- capture the flag
- coin collection battle royale (might rely on player limit to block connections to losers until the round is done)

styling stuff

- mobile friendly
- environment styling
- make loading screen between rounds prettier

unprobables

- emotes
- square career mode full of jokes
